# Jack Gooday | Penetration tester
Hi, I'm Jack, a final year uni student in the UK. I'm primarily interested in hardening secure infrastructure, Active Directory, PKI, Cloud and all things offensive security. I will be sharing stuff I think is interesting on here, starting with writeups of my methodology for some of my favourite Hack The Box machines :D



## Certifications
I hold the following industry certifications:
- Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
- Offensive Security Certified Wireless Professional (OSWP)
- Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)
- EC-Council Certified Security Specialist (ECSS)  
- HackTheBox Prolabs: Offshore

I'm currently working on CRTO and OSEP, and will hopefully complete some more HTB prolabs in prep for these. I'm also becoming equally enjoying cloud training on Azure & AWS :)
